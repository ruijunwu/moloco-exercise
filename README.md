# Introduction

> Implemented the multivariate regression with L1 regularization and gradient descent alogorithm to find parameters minimizing costfuction without using any ML packages and functions with Matlab. You could see link for matlab code here [Matlab:regression and gradient descent](https://github.com/ruijunwu/moloco-exercise/blob/master/Regression.md) and [data set used](https://github.com/ruijunwu/moloco-exercise/blob/master/regress.csv)


> SQL part is to write some complex queries to answer the questions. Full sql queries is [here](https://github.com/ruijunwu/moloco-exercise/blob/master/sql.md) for the [data set](https://github.com/ruijunwu/moloco-exercise/blob/master/Adops%20%26%20Data%20Scientist%20Sample%20Data.xlsx).
